# ProgSoc Git Workshop Demo

This is a demo project for the ProgSoc Git Workshop.

The code used here was copied from this blog post: https://jamesinkala.com/blog/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-nodejs-game/

## instructions

You need to have nodejs installed in your system.
Switch to the projects directory and

```sh
$ node index.js
```

## game-play instructions

The game automatically assigns names and characters ('X' and 'O') to the two players.
On prompt provide the position to place your next character in the range of 1-9. Positions are counted from left to right, top to bottom:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
</table>
